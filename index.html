        E-commerce Tracking With Google Analytics and Google Tag Manager

    In order to setup ecommerce tracking we assume that you successfully implemented Google Analytics with Google Tag Manager.
Ecommerce tracking enables the tracking of sales data on the thank you page (confirmation or checkout page). This includes all information about your shopping basket like number of sales, products, revenues, value per order, etc.
In other words, the confirmation page features a data layer with all information about the transaction, which we can extract with the Google Tag Manager and Google Analytics implementation.

    As discussed at the end of the previous post, we recommend Google Tag Manager (GTM) as an umbrella for all your tracking tokens and code snippets. Even if Google Analytics is the only service you use, GTM remains a simple and expandable option.
The big advantage of GTM is that you only have to add a single code snippet from Google Tag Manager to your website instead of including multiple tracking snippets from services like Google Analytics, AdWords, AdWords Remarketing, Facebook, etc.

    <p>In order to gain insights to your website&rsquo;s traffic and user behavior from reports or data analysis, you have to collect data of the website usage first.  Google Analytics does the core reporting and data collection. In this post we explain how to setup up a Google Analytics account with standard page tracking. If you already have a working Google Analytics account you can skip this post.</p>

    Many who use Google Analytics (GA) to track their websites&rsquo; online traffic only set up a basic tracking implementation. I.e., copy and paste Google&rsquo;s tracking code snippet into one&rsquo;s website and start collecting data.
Doing so is sufficient to obtain basic metrics such as visitors or page views. Yet simply placing a basic code snippet falls short of both: deeper and regular analysis of your (e-commerce) online business. And in turn it also falls short of actually learning from information by steadily observing metrics and assess them over time.
